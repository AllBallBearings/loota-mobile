information with the hunt creator for communication purposes only.
```

## App Store Connect Updates

### 1. Age Rating - Keep 4+ ✅

**"Contests" Question**: Answer **"None"**

**Justification to Use**:
```
Loota is a social platform that facilitates connections between hunt creators
and participants. Hunt creators may privately offer prizes, but Loota does NOT
run contests, process prizes, or guarantee rewards. This is similar to how
Meetup facilitates events or Facebook allows event organizing. All prize
arrangements are between users.
```

### 2. App Description - Add Disclaimer

**Where**: App Store Connect > Your App > App Store > Description

**Add this section** after your features:

```markdown
⚠️ PRIZE DISCLAIMER
Hunt creators may offer prizes at their discretion. Loota is a platform that
connects players with hunt creators. We do not guarantee, process, or verify
prizes. All prize arrangements are between hunt creators and winners. For full
details, see our Terms of Service at https://loota.fun/terms
```

### 3. URLs to Add

In App Store Connect metadata:

- **Privacy Policy URL**: `https://loota.fun/privacy` (REQUIRED)
- **Support URL**: `https://loota.fun/support` (REQUIRED)
- **Marketing URL** (optional): `https://loota.fun`

### 4. App Review Notes

**Where**: App Store Connect > Your App > App Review Information > Notes

**Add this text**:

```
PRIZE SYSTEM CLARIFICATION:

Loota is a social platform that connects treasure hunt creators with
participants. Hunt creators may privately offer prizes to winners, but:

1. Loota does NOT process, guarantee, or verify prizes
2. Loota does NOT handle any payments or transactions
3. All prize arrangements are between hunt creators and participants
4. Loota only facilitates contact information exchange

This is similar to how Meetup facilitates events but doesn't control
outcomes, or how Facebook allows users to organize events with prizes.

We have clear disclaimers in:
- In-app modal (shown before joining hunts)
- Terms of Service (https://loota.fun/terms)
- Privacy Policy (https://loota.fun/privacy)

All pages are live and accessible for review.
```
