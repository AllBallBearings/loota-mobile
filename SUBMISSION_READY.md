## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### iOS 18.0 Requirement
**Why**: The app uses RealityKit's `BillboardComponent` (iOS 18+) and advanced AR features that are not available in earlier iOS versions.

**Impact**: Only devices running iOS 18.0+ can download the app (iPhone XS/XR and newer models released from 2018 onward).

**Alternative**: To support iOS 17 or 16, you would need to:
- Remove or provide fallbacks for `BillboardComponent` usage
- Replace `MeshResource.generateCylinder` with iOS 17-compatible alternatives
- Update `.onChange` modifiers to use iOS 16-compatible syntax
- Test thoroughly on older iOS versions

### Privacy Requirements
The app collects:
- **Location**: Precise location for AR treasure placement
- **Phone Number**: For prize fulfillment between winners and creators
- **Name**: User identification
- **Device ID**: User account management

All data collection must be clearly explained in privacy policy.

### ARKit Requirements
- **Minimum Device**: iPhone 6s or newer (2015+)
- **Real Camera**: App cannot be fully tested in simulator
- **Real Location**: Location-based features require physical device testing
