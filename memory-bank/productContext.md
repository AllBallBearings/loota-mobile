# Product Context

_This document describes why this project exists, the problems it solves, how it should work, and the user experience goals._

## Problem Statement

Users want to participate in engaging, real-world activities that combine technology and exploration. Traditional treasure hunts can be difficult to organize and lack the dynamic, interactive element that modern technology can provide.

## Proposed Solution

The Loota platform provides a way for people to create and participate in virtual treasure hunts. The Next.js web app allows "hunt creators" to place virtual markers at physical locations. The iOS app provides an augmented reality experience for "hunters" to find and collect these markers. A simple link shared by the creator launches the hunt on the hunter's iPhone.

## User Stories

_As a hunter, I want to open a link and have it immediately start a virtual treasure hunt on my phone so that I can easily begin playing._

_As a hunter, I want to see virtual items in the real world through my phone's camera so that I can experience the magic of augmented reality._

_As a hunter, I want to "collect" or "Loot" the virtual items I find to track my progress in the hunt._

## User Experience (UX) Goals

(What are the key principles that will guide the user experience? e.g., simplicity, efficiency, delight.)
